## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use ARIA attributes for accessibility.

Still, some of Figma files are buggy:

- the quote paths are not well-defined
- some colors are missing - like color-card-image-border
- shadows must be guessed, or you can use a Figma plug-in like "Figma drop and inner shadow to CSS box shadow" to find
  them

### Useful resources

- ["Figma drop and inner shadow to CSS box shadow"]() - This helped me for finding shadows of the elements in Figma
  file. I really liked this plug-in and will
  use it going forward. You can find it in Figma menu - Plugins - Manage plugins... (search for it; it is free)

I used
the [functions to url encode the svg string](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13367868/how-to-modify-the-fill-color-of-an-svg-image-when-being-served-as-background-ima)
written by Philipp Kühn to put the quote on the first card.
